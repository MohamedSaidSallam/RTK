# RTK

RTK stands for "Report To Kill" which is the name of the bot responsible for collecting reports about users from users and to pass proper judgment upon those of high report count.

The System works as follows:

## Reports

Users can report other Users using the Discord bot. The discord bot will update the database containing the number of reports of each user.

## Kills

After sufficient time has passed, The user with the highest Report count will face judgment for his acts against other users.

### Note

This is an inside joke between me and my friends taken from games where players can report other players for intintailly ruining the game. We started saying "Reported" whenever  someone did something wrong and I thought it would be funny to create a bot to keep count.
